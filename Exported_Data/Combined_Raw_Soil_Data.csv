Look for Lime Recommendations and N-P-K Fertilizer Recommendations. The lime recommendation is always listed next to the first crop and will be based on the higher target pH if the pH targets for crop 1 and crop 2 differ. Application at the indicated rate will raise soil pH to the optimal level for the plant you specified and should be sufficient for 2 to 3 years, depending on soil type. Common target pH values are as follows: 5.0 for azalea, camellia, rhododendron and mt. laurel; 5.5 for centipedegrass; 6.0 for other lawn grasses, shrubbery, and; flowering plants; and 6.5 for vegetable gardens. N-P-K Recommendations are based on the nitrogen (N) needs of the plants being grown and the soil test results for phosphorus (P-I) and potassium (K-I); a 50 to 70 index for either is optimum.

Look for Lime Recommendations and N-P-K Fertilizer Recommendations. The lime recommendation is always listed next to the first crop and will be based on the higher target pH if the pH targets for crop 1 and crop 2 differ. Application at the indicated rate will raise soil pH to the optimal level for the plant you specified and should be sufficient for 2 to 3 years, depending on soil type. Common target pH values are as follows: 5.0 for azalea, camellia, rhododendron and mt. laurel; 5.5 for centipedegrass; 6.0 for other lawn grasses, shrubbery, and; flowering plants; and 6.5 for vegetable gardens. N-P-K Recommendations are based on the nitrogen (N) needs of the plants being grown and the soil test results for phosphorus (P-I) and potassium (K-I); a 50 to 70 index for either is optimum. If the exact fertilizer cannot be found, find the closest match and adjust the rate accordingly. Refer to 'Understanding the Soil Report' (last page of this report) for additional explanation and links to helpful information.",NA,NA,NA,NA,2/7/2020,Clinton

Look for Lime Recommendations and N-P-K Fertilizer Recommendations. The lime recommendation is always listed next to the first crop and will be based on the higher target pH if the pH targets for crop 1 and crop 2 differ. Application at the indicated rate will raise soil pH to the optimal level for the plant you specified and should be sufficient for 2 to 3 years, depending on soil type. Common target pH values are as follows: 5.0 for azalea, camellia, rhododendron and mt. laurel; 5.5 for centipedegrass; 6.0 for other lawn grasses, shrubbery, and; flowering plants; and 6.5 for vegetable gardens. N-P-K Recommendations are based on the nitrogen (N) needs of the plants being grown and the soil test results for phosphorus (P-I) and potassium (K-I); a 50 to 70 index for either is optimum. If the exact fertilizer cannot be found, find the closest match and adjust the rate accordingly.

Application at the indicated rate will raise soil pH to the optimal level for the plant you specified and should be sufficient for 2 to 3 years, depending on soil type. Common target pH values are as follows: 5.0 for azalea, camellia, rhododendron and mt. laurel; 5.5 for centipedegrass; 6.0 for other lawn grasses, shrubbery, and; flowering plants; and 6.5 for vegetable gardens. N-P-K Recommendations are based on the nitrogen (N) needs of the plants being grown and the soil test results for phosphorus (P-I) and potassium (K-I); a 50 to 70 index for either is optimum. If the exact fertilizer cannot be found, find the closest match and adjust the rate accordingly. Refer to 'Understanding the Soil Report' (last page of this report) for additional explanation and links to helpful information.",NA,NA,NA,NA,2/20/2018,Caswell

Tissue that is living is yellow or purple. About 18-N, 18-phosphate, 90-potash, and 34-sulfur were applied. The planting date was 4/19/2019. The previous crop was affected in the minimum tilled field. Low pH and low magnesium are issues. Both calcium and magnesium are very low. Fertilizer salts are elevated but I do not consider this to be the issue. This appears to be classic low pH that would cause aluminum toxicity of the root system in addition to Ca and Mg being low. Dolomitic lime should be used before the next crop. Consider its application and replanting other crops (soybeans) depending on herbicides used. Chris Jernigan will be in contact with you. David H.
