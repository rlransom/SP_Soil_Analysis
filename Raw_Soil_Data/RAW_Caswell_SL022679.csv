Roots were poor. Leaves were yellow. A fertilizer rate of 100 lbs/ acre potassium and 36 lbs/ acre sulfur were  applied. The plantings occurred on May1, 2016. The overall plant stand was very poor, stressed and overall poor growth through out the season. The soil potassium is marginal. The other fertility including pH is not an issue.  Less than desirable potassium can be an issue; however based on the symptoms described investigate if nematodes are involved by submitting samples for nematode assay.
