Tissue that is living is yellow or purple. About 18-N, 18-phosphate, 90-potash, and 34-sulfur were applied. The planting date was 4/19/2019. The previous crop was affected in the minimum tilled field. Low pH and low magnesium are issues. Both calcium and magnesium are very low. Fertilizer salts are elevated but I do not consider this to be the issue. This appears to be classic low pH that would cause aluminum toxicity of the root system in addition to Ca and Mg being low. Dolomitic lime should be used before the next crop. Consider its application and replanting other crops (soybeans) depending on herbicides used. Chris Jernigan will be in contact with you. David H.
