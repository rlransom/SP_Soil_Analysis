Look for Lime Recommendations and N-P-K Fertilizer Recommendations. The lime recommendation is always listed next to the first crop and will be based on the higher target pH if the pH targets for crop 1 and crop 2 differ. Application at the indicated rate will raise soil pH to the optimal level for the plant you specified and should be sufficient for 2 to 3 years, depending on soil type. Common target pH values are as follows: 5.0 for azalea, camellia, rhododendron and mt. laurel; 5.5 for centipedegrass; 6.0 for other lawn grasses, shrubbery, and; flowering plants; and 6.5 for vegetable gardens. N-P-K Recommendations are based on the nitrogen (N) needs of the plants being grown and the soil test results for phosphorus (P-I) and potassium (K-I); a 50 to 70 index for either is optimum. If the exact fertilizer cannot be found, find the closest match and adjust the rate accordingly.
